## 🧰 Game Tools and Data Extraction

For data mining, resource parsing, build calculators, and profit tools.

---

### **Game Data Extraction / Analysis**

**[PotRooms/StarResonanceTool](https://github.com/PotRooms/StarResonanceTool)**
- Parses game asset files like Lua scripts, protobufs, and asset bundles.
- Useful for modding, research, and analyzing game resources.
- Supports extracting JSON tables and Unity asset bundles for offline analysis.

**[PotRooms/StarResonanceData](https://github.com/PotRooms/StarResonanceData)**
- Parses game data for Blue Protocol: Star Resonance.
- Extracts combat, assets, and protocol information for analysis.
- Supports research and tool development using official game files.

**[HuaChunOXO/StarResonanceModuleSolver](https://github.com/HuaChunOXO/StarResonanceModuleSolver)**
* This project is a modified version based on **StarResonanceAutoMod**.

* The original **StarResonanceAutoMod** itself was derived from **StarResonanceDamageCounter**.

* Therefore, this project continues to use the **AGPL v3 open-source license**.

* **Quick Start:**

  1. If you haven’t used the above tools before, install **Npcap** from the included archive or download it via the provided link.
  2. Double-click **模组求解器.exe (Module Solver.exe)**, select your network card, and click **Start Capture**.
  3. After the capture begins, switching maps, changing channels, or relogging will allow the program to obtain your module data.
  4. Once modules are captured, you can manually stop the capture, or it will stop automatically after 60 seconds of inactivity.
  5. Since the program uses an enumeration algorithm, avoid having too many modules; use **Delete Low-Level Modules** to reduce them.
  6. Set **target** and **excluded attributes** as needed — results will appear under **Target Requirement Plan**.
  7. After selecting a profession, results will also show under **Profession Attribute Plan** (affected by target/excluded attributes).
  8. For a cleaner display, you can **export results to a Word file**.

* **Note:** Profession module recommendations follow in-game defaults; if you have specific attribute goals, use the **target/exclusion** options to customize results.

### **Build & Optimization Calculators**

**[c0derceejay/unofficial-blueprotocol-star-resonance](https://github.com/c0derceejay/unofficial-blueprotocol-star-resonance)**
- Community-driven build calculator and sharing platform.
- Supports all classes, gear, and skill setups with local browser storage.
- Provides real-time calculations and power rating for builds.

**[fudiyangjin/StarResonanceAutoMod](https://github.com/fudiyangjin/StarResonanceAutoMod)**
* This tool captures live network packets from *Star Resonance* to extract in-game module data automatically.
* It filters and optimizes module combinations using a C++ algorithm core with optional GPU (CUDA/OpenCL) acceleration.
* Users can target or exclude attributes like “Crit Focus” or “Intellect Boost” to find the best four-module sets.
* It supports both CPU and GPU builds—run the `.exe` version for quick use or Python source for development.
* Requires Npcap installed on Windows 10/11 to capture packets from the game client.
* Basic usage: open CMD, navigate to the folder, and run `.\StarResonanceAutoMod.exe -a -lang en`.
* For offline analysis, use `.\StarResonanceAutoMod.exe -lv -lang en` after one successful capture.
* Developers can clone the repo, install dependencies, build C++ extensions, and run `python star_railway_monitor.py -a`.
