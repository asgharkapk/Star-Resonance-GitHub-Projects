### **Fishing Automation**

[**bk360/BPSR-AutoFisher-V1**](https://github.com/bk360/BPSR-AutoFisher-V1)
- An automated fishing assistant for *Blue Protocol: Star Resonance (BPSR)*.
* Allows the player to start fishing automatically through a simple Python script (`python main.py`).
* Detects when the fishing rod breaks and handles the “Continue Fishing” button automatically, reducing manual interaction.
* Designed for quick setup: navigate to the directory in CMD or PowerShell, and run the main file to begin automation.

[**scylian/bpsr-autofish**](https://github.com/scylian/bpsr-autofish)
- A computer vision automation framework tailored for BPSR’s fishing mechanics.
* Implements precise mouse and keyboard control combined with OpenCV-based image detection.
* Features advanced safety checks, fail-safe conditions, and coordinate validation for reliable automation.
* Provides modular Python APIs for easy integration into custom scripts, along with over 60 unit tests to ensure robustness.
* Can be adapted for other automation tasks beyond fishing through its extensible design.

[**fishing-dev-sm/bpsr_autofishing**](https://github.com/fishing-dev-sm/bpsr_autofishing)
- An improved, vision-based automatic fishing script for *Star Resonance*.
* Uses pixel color analysis (HSV/BGR) to detect bites, reel timing, and “fish escaped” conditions.
* Adapts to any 16:9 resolution with DPI scaling and automatic region-of-interest (ROI) adjustment.
* Features dynamic mode switching between fast tapping and stable long-press reeling based on color detection.
* Includes timeout protection, intelligent recovery (auto-refishing, reconnecting, or re-equipping rods), and detailed logging.
* Designed to run safely without altering game files or memory, ensuring non-invasive automation.

**[Xuan-cc/ShiroFisher-StarResonanceSmartFishing](https://github.com/Xuan-cc/ShiroFisher-StarResonanceSmartFishing)**
- Python script to automate fishing gameplay.
- Detects fish bites, casts rods, collects fish, and manages bait automatically.
- Uses OpenCV and PyAutoGUI for computer vision and input simulation.

[**ArtjomsBogatirjovs/bpsr-fishing**](https://github.com/ArtjomsBogatirjovs/bpsr-fishing)
- An external auto-fishing system for *Star Resonance* based on image recognition.
* Interacts only through the visible game UI using Windows API calls—no game memory or file modifications.
* Uses AI-based fish detection and auto-casting for accurate and efficient fishing cycles.
* Compatible with all 16:9 resolutions in both fullscreen and windowed mode.
* Includes detailed troubleshooting for display settings, antivirus conflicts, and input remapping.
* Focused on safe, educational use—prohibits any commercial redistribution or paid automation services.

### **Mod / Attribute Optimization**

[**fishing-dev-sm/bpsr_automodule**](https://github.com/fishing-dev-sm/bpsr_automodule)
- A comprehensive OCR-powered optimizer for *BPSR* modules and attributes.
* Uses Python, Flask, and OpenCV to analyze screenshots and optimize mod setups.
* Offers a modern Web UI for drag-and-drop image uploads, real-time recognition, and result visualization.
* Employs multi-strategy OCR recognition, multi-objective optimization, and intelligent filtering to find best attribute combinations.
* Cross-platform support for Windows, macOS, and Linux with one-click setup scripts and JSON result exports.
* Designed for players and theorycrafters seeking efficient builds without manually comparing modules.
