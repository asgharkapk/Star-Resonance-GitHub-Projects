[**caaatto/BlueMeter**](https://github.com/caaatto/BlueMeter)
* It’s a desktop tool called **BlueMeter** for Blue Protocol: Star Resonance that analyses real‑time combat data (DPS/HPS etc) by capturing network packets and presenting them as overlay stats.
* It does **not modify the game client or its files**—it passively monitors traffic to compute damage/healing metrics.
* How it works: you download the release ZIP or build from source (.NET 8.0 required), install and run the application, and it listens to your network adapter via a packet capture driver (e.g., Npcap) to parse combat packets.
* After launching, the overlay will display your stats such as DPS, HPS, peak damage, contribution percentage and other combat‑related numbers while you play.
* To use: extract the release to a folder, run `BlueMeter.WPF.exe` (or the built executable), ensure .NET 8.0 runtime is installed, start the game and fight as usual—stats are captured real‑time.
* Alternatively, for building from source: install .NET 8.0 SDK, clone the repo, build with `dotnet build -c Release`, or `dotnet publish` to generate the executable.
* The UI is a visible overlay you can move or resize, it reads network packets from your system’s adapter, decodes game events and shows them in meaningful metrics.
* Users must run it under their own responsibility—while it is non‑invasive (no memory injection or file modding), usage may still carry risk depending on game policy.

[**vegask/BPSR-Meter**](https://github.com/vegask/BPSR-Meter)
* BPSR Meter is a real‑time DPS/HPS overlay tool for Blue Protocol: Star Resonance, built on top of packet‑capture techniques from earlier meters. ([GitHub][1])
* It captures network traffic using drivers like Npcap (WinPcap‑compatible mode) to parse combat events without modifying the game client. ([GitHub][2])
* For end users: download the installer from GitHub Releases, install Npcap first, then run the application (Windows 10/11 supported). ([GitHub][2])
* For developers: clone the repo, install Node.js v22+, run `npm install`, then build or start in dev mode (`npm run dev`, `npm run build`).
* The architecture uses Electron + Vite for the renderer UI, Express for API backend, and socket.io for real‑time event updates.
* At runtime the overlay positions itself (top‑right by default), updates stats every ~50 ms, supports scaling and click‑through transparency, and highlights the local player plus top performers.
* It resets stats when you change server channels or instances (since new packet streams are detected) and may show “Unknown” for players who joined before the meter started. ([Reddit][3])
* Note: Because it listens to packets, use at your own risk; community posts mention concerns about security and compatibility with anti‑cheat systems. ([Steam Community][4])

[**StarAutoFish script by YHZI**](https://github.com/YHZI/StarAutoFish)

* It’s a Python‑based autofishing script designed for the game Star Resonance (or possibly a variant/related game) — repository includes `autoFish.py`, `getMousePos.py`, and various image assets (e.g., `left.png`, `right.png`, `no_cast.png`).
* The script likely uses screen image recognition (matching bait/fishing UI visuals, fish icons or fishing indicators) plus simulated mouse clicks to automate the fishing action.
* The presence of `getMousePos.py` suggests a helper tool to capture screen coordinates for the target UI elements.
* The image assets like `continueFishing.png`, `use.png`, etc., indicate the script checks for specific in‑game visuals (e.g., “use” button, “no cast” state) and acts accordingly.
* No README provides full installation or usage steps; you would need Python installed and likely run the script in administrator mode (for screen capture or UI simulation) and ensure the game is visible on screen.
* Because it automates in‑game actions via UI simulation, usage may conflict with game terms of service—use at your own risk.
* The repository is small and appears to be a personal project rather than a polished commercial tool.

If you like, I can check the repository in more detail and **write exact steps** to set it up (with caveats about risks).
---
[**leo2971998/AutoFishingTool-BlueProtocolStarResonance**](https://github.com/leo2971998/AutoFishingTool-BlueProtocolStarResonance)
* It is a Python‑based automatic fishing tool for Blue Protocol: Star Resonance that casts and reels automatically, detects fish rarity, tracks catches, and can auto‑buy rods and bait.
* How it works: it uses image‑recognition to detect in‑game UI cues (like fish rarity icons or bait empty prompts) and simulates mouse actions to fish, purchase bait/rods, and log statistics.
* How to use: install Python 3.12+ (ensure “Add Python to PATH” and pip installed), then run the provided `install.bat` to set up.
* Then run `run.bat`, make sure the game is running and visible, press F5 to start fishing, F6 to pause, and ESC to stop.
* The game window must use 16:9 resolution, be in the foreground (not moved), and overlays/streaming software should be disabled.
* The tool runs in Administrator mode and relies on capturing visible UI elements (screenshots are exported in debug mode if detection fails).
* It keeps a log of catches in real time and categorises common / rare / mythical fish for statistics and tracking.
* You should follow the troubleshooting steps if it fails: ensure Python version is correct, run as admin, check screen capture assets match your resolution, and see debug screenshots for what the script sees.

[**f1shyondrugs/BlueProtocol-Autofarm**](https://github.com/f1shyondrugs/BlueProtocol-Autofarm)
* It’s an automated fishing bot for Blue Protocol: Star Resonance that uses computer‑vision to detect bobber movement and simulate fishing actions.
* It detects specific pixel coordinates to identify when a fish bites and then automatically casts, reels, and collects the catch.
* Features include a transparent always‑on‑top GUI overlay, hotkey controls (F1 to pause/resume, F2 to restart), and a fish counter tracking total catches.
* Must run at **1920×1080 resolution** since coordinate and color values are hard‑coded for that resolution only.
* Before starting, install dependencies via `pip install -r requirements.txt`, configure optional Discord webhook for notifications, and run `python fishing.py`.
* Game window must be visible and focused, no overlays or streaming apps interfering, and the bot runs in Administrator mode to properly simulate input.
* The bot monitors colors such as orange for bobber movement, gray for catch detection, and uses key presses (‘A’/’D’) for guiding fish when needed.
* It includes emergency recovery logic: if an unexpected color is detected it resets the process, and users must configure optional Discord webhook and verify screen config.

## 04-Translation.md

### **Localization / Translation / Misc**

[**Down98/BPSREngPatcher**](https://github.com/Down98/BPSREngPatcher)
- A patching utility to enable English language support for *Blue Protocol: Star Resonance*.
* Requires installation of the .NET 8.0 Runtime environment.
* Users must place the patcher executable inside the `AppData\LocalLow\bokura\Star\localsave` folder (where `localsave.bytes` exists).
* Once executed, it modifies local save data to enable English translation, simplifying localization for non-Chinese users.
Here’s a 12‑line summary with suspicion checks for the project BPSREngPatcher:

1. It’s described as a Windows tool built in C# (.NET 8.0) that patches game files by placing an .exe in the game’s localsave folder.
2. The instructions tell you to download a pre‑built .exe from a GitHub release and drop it into `AppData\LocalLow\bokura\Star\localsave`.
3. It claims to work for the game (presumably Blue Protocol: Star Resonance), but the name “EngPatcher” and the folder note suggests it **modifies game save or client data**.
4. It links to a VirusTotal report of the .exe: `113bec441e53da02d5c5b38e94257bd62b2f1a3af94010b4984fb5757ad87766` — implying potential risk or suspicion that the file is flagged or analysed.
5. The README gives minimal details about what exactly the patcher does: “Add files via upload”, but doesn’t explain the mechanics of the patch or why it’s needed.
6. Because it involves placing an .exe inside the game’s local save folder, it may **violate the game’s Terms of Service** or trigger anti‑cheat / detection mechanisms.
7. There is no publicly documented transparency about what changes it makes — this is a red flag for trust/security.
8. It may enable modifications, cheats, or unauthorized edits of game data, making it potentially suspicious or unsafe, especially for online games.
9. The project does not show source code detail (only a `.sln` and some uploads) so verifying its internal logic may be difficult.
10. Users should be cautious: before running any .exe placed in game folders, ensure you understand what it changes, backup data, and check for anti‑cheat risks.
11. If you choose to proceed, verify the file on your own system with VirusTotal (or similar), run it in a sandbox or isolated environment first, and monitor for unusual behavior.
12. In summary: the tool could be useful if well‑documented and safe, but the lack of documentation, placement in game folder, and patching nature raise **significant suspicion**—use at your own risk.
Here’s a 12‑line summary of the patcher project with a suspicion check:

1. It’s named **BPSREngPatcher**, a .NET 8.0 C# project designed to patch a localsave.bytes file in the game folder.
2. The project uses Brotli compression/decompression to modify the “LanguageIndex” field inside the game’s local save file, then re‑compresses and writes it back.
3. Instructions ask the user to place the downloaded .exe into `AppData\LocalLow\bokura\Star\localsave` (same folder as localsave.bytes) and run it.
4. The tool thereby modifies user save data (or game local data), which means it is effectively patching or altering game files.
5. Because it is modifying game save or config files, it may violate the game’s Terms of Service or anti‑cheat policies.
6. The repository provides a link to a VirusTotal report of the executable, indicating that the file may have been flagged or analysed for malware.
7. The README lacks full transparency on what all modifications occur beyond the “LanguageIndex” change, leaving unknown side‑effects.
8. The nature of patching local save files suggests risk: if the game validates localsave files or server syncs, this could lead to account penalties.
9. Users should verify the executable via antivirus/VirusTotal, run it in a sandbox environment, and backup originals before use.
10. Because it executes an .exe inside a game folder, there is elevated suspicion of unintended consequences (e.g., data corruption, detection, or malicious code).
11. If one chooses to proceed, best practice: backup the localsave.bytes file, run the patcher offline, check and test results before using it in normal gameplay.
12. Overall: while this tool may serve a legitimate purpose for language index or translation patching, the patch‑nature, lack of deep documentation, and placement in game folder raise strong suspicion — use at your own risk.

🗺️ Complete Guide to the Best *Star Resonance* & *Blue Protocol* Interactive Maps – Resources, Features, and Community Tips

---

Hey everyone 👋

If you're exploring **Star Resonance** or **Blue Protocol** and want to make the most out of your gameplay — from finding hidden treasures to optimizing routes and locating rare collectibles — here’s a deep dive into the best **interactive maps** currently available. I’ve tested several of these tools, and each one offers something unique depending on what you’re trying to do in-game.

---

### 🌌 **1. Star Resonance Map – [starresonancemap.com](https://starresonancemap.com/)**

This is the **most comprehensive fan-made map** for *Star Resonance* at the moment. It covers nearly every collectible, quest marker, and point of interest across the available regions.

**Key features:**

* **Dynamic map layers** – You can toggle between resources, chests, teleporters, bosses, and event points.
* **Search & filter system** – Quickly locate specific materials or rare spawns.
* **Progress tracking** – Mark completed objectives or looted items, perfect for completionists.
* **Responsive design** – Works well on both desktop and mobile, so you can use it while gaming on the go.
* **Community input** – Markers are actively updated by players, ensuring near real-time accuracy.

**Use tip:** Create a free account if you plan to track your collection progress — it syncs across devices and helps you avoid retreading the same areas.

---

### ⚔️ **2. Blue Protocol Interactive Map – [blueprotocol.interactivemap.app](https://blueprotocol.interactivemap.app/)**

Although this one is technically for *Blue Protocol*, it deserves a mention because it shares the same interactive foundation and style that *Star Resonance* players can appreciate.

**Highlights:**

* **Highly detailed world overlay** with spawn timers, NPCs, resource nodes, and hidden chests.
* **Route planning tool** for farming efficiency.
* **Global marker database** contributed by users, very similar to Genshin Impact’s fan maps.
* **Fast performance** even with multiple layers activated.

**Why it’s relevant:** The same team or style of community-driven mapping might inspire how *Star Resonance* maps evolve, especially for players switching between the two games.

---

### 🌠 **3. Star Resonance Global Map Hub – [starresonance.th.gl](https://starresonance.th.gl/)**

This one acts as a **map aggregator and region portal**, providing direct links to detailed map instances for different zones in *Star Resonance*.

**Features:**

* **Region-based navigation** – Jump directly into maps like *Asteria Plains* or *Celestia Heights*.
* **Lightweight and fast** – Loads quickly, ideal for lower-end devices or quick lookups.
* **Integrated updates** – Automatically syncs with newly released map layers from the main database.
* **Language support** – Community translations are being added gradually.

**Pro tip:** Bookmark this page as your map hub. It’s a convenient starting point for exploring new regions as they get released.

---

### 🌾 **4. Asteria Plains Detailed Map – [starresonance.th.gl/maps/Asteria%20Plains](https://starresonance.th.gl/maps/Asteria%20Plains)**

This is a **zoomed-in, detailed version** focused on the *Asteria Plains* region — one of the earliest and most resource-rich areas in the game.

**What makes it great:**

* **Accurate item spawn locations** – Ideal for farming early-game materials.
* **Mini-event markers** showing puzzle spots, elite enemies, and special chests.
* **Interactive pins** with item/tooltips so you know exactly what each node drops.
* **High map resolution**, allowing deep zoom levels for tight farming routes.

**Community tip:** This specific region map often gets updates first before the global one. If you’re grinding Asteria Plains daily, this is the most efficient tool you can use.

---

### 💬 **Final Thoughts & Community Invitation**

All four resources together form an **ecosystem of exploration tools** for both *Star Resonance* and *Blue Protocol* fans. Whether you’re a completionist, lore hunter, or casual explorer, these maps make a huge difference in how efficiently you can plan routes and track your progress.

If you find missing markers, incorrect placements, or want to share farming routes, consider contributing back — most of these maps have community submission forms or Discords for that purpose.
