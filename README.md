**Highlights:**

* **Highly detailed world overlay** with spawn timers, NPCs, resource nodes, and hidden chests.
* **Route planning tool** for farming efficiency.
* **Global marker database** contributed by users, very similar to Genshin Impact‚Äôs fan maps.
* **Fast performance** even with multiple layers activated.

**Why it‚Äôs relevant:** The same team or style of community-driven mapping might inspire how *Star Resonance* maps evolve, especially for players switching between the two games.

---

### üå† **3. Star Resonance Global Map Hub ‚Äì [starresonance.th.gl](https://starresonance.th.gl/)**
